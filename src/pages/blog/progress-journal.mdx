    ## Project summary
    Goal of this project was to make a training journaling app that has a generic data structure, so that it can be used for any kind of training. This is achieved by letting the user create subjects, which contain fields and inputs. The user can then create entries for the subject and view training history through reading entries and viewing charts of training data.

    Progress Journal doesn't hold the hand of the user, this app is a tool with fully customizable subjects for the user to configure.
