Prototype landing page for a made-up soda brand. The goal of this project was to create a visually fresh landing page with HTML+CSS from the designer's mockup. The 3D models were created in Blender.

Built as an Astro project with vanilla HTML and CSS. The 3D models for the sodacans were created in Blender, rendered as images except for the hero banner section where I render the 3D model into a html canvas with React-Three-Fiber.

The design's main focus was full screen sections with high contrasting elements.
