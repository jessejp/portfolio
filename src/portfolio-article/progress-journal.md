I made the <a class="text-brandMain" href="https://www.figma.com/file/PVcrJV05Z5n0GSwusOl4jN/Progress-Journal---%40shadcn%2Fui?type=design&node-id=103-985&mode=design" target="_blank">Figma layout</a> for this project using the @shadcn/ui design system.

I was thinking of a training app with a general design for the data so that it could be used in multiple contexts or hobbies. There hasn't been any design work put into the app yet, as I've been focusing on developing the functionalities.

I was excited to try making a web application using the <a class="text-brandMain" href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">T3-stack</a>, a full-stack, typesafe Next.js developement environment. The development experience was nice, felt quite fast and bug-free to ship features. ðŸ™‚
