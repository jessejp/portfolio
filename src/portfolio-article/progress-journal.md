<i>Concious training with a goal, execution and analysis of the session are the key to becoming great</i>

I was thinking of a training app with a generic design for the data so that it could be used in multiple contexts or hobbies. There hasn't been any design work put into the app yet, as I've been focusing on developing the functionalities.

I was excited to try making a web application using the <a class="text-brandMain" href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">T3-stack</a>, a full-stack, typesafe Next.js developement environment. The development experience was nice, felt quite fast and bug-free to ship features. ðŸ™‚
