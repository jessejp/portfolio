I was thinking of a training app with a generic design for the data so that it could be used in multiple contexts or hobbies. The design is built for mobile mainly.

I was excited to try making a web application using the [T3-stack](https://create.t3.gg/), a full-stack, typesafe Next.js developement environment. The development experience was nice, felt quite fast and bug-free to ship features. ðŸ™‚
