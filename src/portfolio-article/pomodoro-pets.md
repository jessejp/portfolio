After <a class="accessible" href="https://threejs-journey.com/certificate/view/27153" target="_blank">completing the three.js journey course</a>, I'm developing a WebGL-based <a class="accessible" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">pomodoro</a> timer app where the user can study with a study pal.

I have a passion for 3D art/experiences and I think there's a fun future in the mix between videogames and apps.
